            <h4>Cognitive Workload Assessment</h4>
            <p>This research focuses on assessing and managing cognitive workload in demanding environments such as
              aviation,
              healthcare, transportation, and defense. It incorporates brain-computer interfaces, EEG headsets, and
              physiological
              sensors for synchronized, multimodal data collection. Various cognitive tasks, including the Letter
              N-back, Flanker
              N-back, and multiple object tracking, are utilized to simulate different levels of mental demand. The
              system enables
              adjustable parameters to model various stress conditions and task complexities. Both subjective metrics,
              such as the
              NASA-TLX, and objective metrics, including EEG and heart rate variability (HRV), are employed to quantify
              workload.
              Machine learning algorithms are used to classify workload states based on these signals. This research
              advances
              real-time monitoring of mental states to optimize performance and prevent errors.

            <h4>EEG Denoising</h4>
            <p>EEG signals are often contaminated by artifacts such as EOG, EMG, and ECG, which can vary based on a
              subject’s
              activities, making it challenging to acquire clean signals. Traditional denoising methods—such as digital
              filtering,
              blind source separation (BSS), wavelet transform (WT), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)—have been
              commonly used
              but may inadvertently remove essential neural information or require complex configurations. Due to these
              limitations,
              researchers have increasingly turned to deep learning models, including Fully Convolutional Neural
              Networks (FCNNs),
              Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Complex CNNs. While these
              models provide
              certain improvements, each comes with its own drawbacks: FCNNs tend to over-smooth the data, RNNs face
              issues with
              gradient stability, CNNs often miss long-term patterns, and Complex CNNs can be resource-intensive. These
              challenges
              highlight the need for the development of enhanced models specifically designed for EEG denoising under
              varying noise
              conditions.

            <h4>Early Stage Dementia Using Natural Language Processing</h4>
            <p>This research focuses on predicting early-stage dementia by analyzing linguistic features in
              conversational transcripts,
              specifically through the Cookie Theft Picture description task. It compares speech patterns between
              individuals with
              probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and age-matched controls. Numerical linguistic features were extracted,
              and machine
              learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), achieved up to 87.5% accuracy for same-age
              classification and
              85.26% for early-stage detection. A “Information Unit” concept was proposed to capture
              content-specific
              language features, demonstrating potential across different languages. When combining the bag-of-words
              approach with
              this information unit, the model achieved an accuracy of 88% using logistic regression. Additionally,
              TF-IDF features
              performed best for early-stage detection. The statistical analysis and machine learning models underscore
              the importance
              of language-based markers for the early identification of Alzheimer's Disease, supporting improved
              screening and
              intervention strategies.</p>

            <h4>A Survey on Early-Stage Dementia Detection Using Natural
              Language Processing: Datasets and Approaches</h4>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization, Dementia, a chronic,
              degenerative condition that affects 55 million people worldwide,
              is prevalent in seniors. To date, there is no cure for dementia, so
              recent advancements in this area emphasize the urgent need for
              detecting early symptoms to facilitate timely intervention strategies. As dementia starts by damaging
              neurons in parts
              of the brain
              responsible for memory, language, and thinking, the analysis of
              language sample could potentially offer a promising avenue for
              detecting subtle cognitive shifts that could allow the possible interventions to slow down the disease’s
              progression and
              improve the
              life of the individuals. We document this paper to explore the potential of leveraging speech and text
              data for
              detecting early-stage
              dementia by leveraging semantic, syntactic, and acoustic features.
              This paper surveys natural language processing (NLP) techniques
              applied to speech, text, audio, and handwritten data in monolingual
              and multilingual settings, focusing on their potential to aid in the
              early detection and understanding of dementia. According to our
              study, most datasets available in this domain are in English, with
              the support vector machine being the most frequently used classification method. Interest is also growing
              in using large
              language
              models to identify the signs of cognitive decline based on language
              patterns.</p>

            <h4>A Survey on Deep Learning-based Smart Assistive Aids for
              Visually Impaired Individuals</h4>
            <p>Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in interacting with society. However, smart
              canes equipped
              with sensors and
              cameras provide a promising solution for safe navigation. AI-based
              assistive devices, including smart canes, utilize machine learning
              algorithms like YOLO and SSD for object detection and recognition
              through in-built cameras. These devices often employ a standard
              controller and switch for navigation strategy, while sensors such
              as Ultrasonic sensors, I/R Lasers, Rain sensors aid in detecting a
              variety of obstacles such as physical objects or water. With continued research, such technology could
              greatly enhance
              the visually
              impaired person’s ability to interact with their surroundings and
              potentially even travel independently.</p>

            <h4>A Survey on Object Detection and Recognition for Blurred and Low-Quality Images: Handling, Deblurring,
              and
              Reconstruction</h4>
            <p>Object detection and recognition in blurred and low-quality images present significant challenges in
              computer vision and
              image processing. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques,
              methodologies,
              and advancements in addressing these challenges. Blurred and low-quality images are encountered in various

              scenarios, such as surveillance, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles, making robust object detection
              and

              advancements in this
              field, with an emphasis on deep learning-based approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on the

            <h4>WIP: A Reconfigurable Testbed for Assessing Cognitive
              Workload in N-back and Multiple Object Tracking Tasks *</h4>
            <p>Cognitive workload assessment and management are critical in managing work efficiency in highstress
              environments and
              long-duration tasks, such as critical infrastructure operations, first-responder
              responses, healthcare, military, and transportation. A major challenge in developing cognitive
              assessment algorithms lies in designing an experimental testbed that integrates diverse systems
              like brain-computer interfaces, physiological sensors, and task-specific hardware for synchronized
              multi-modal data collection. This paper presents a novel reconfigurable testbed for assessing cognitive
              workload using
              Letter N-back, Flanker N-back, and multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks.
              The testbed features customizable parameters such as trial length, difficulty level, and task complexity,
              allowing
              simulation of various stress levels. The integration of Neuroelectrics EEG headsets and Bluetooth-enabled
              physiological
              sensors ensures real-time multimodal data acquisition.
              In addition, the modular design supports future expansion for new tasks and devices, fostering
              advancements in cognitive neuroscience and human performance research.</p>

              Morphological Image
              Processing and Template Matching Technique</h4>
            <p>We constructed a model to build an effective traffic monitoring system, especially in rainy seasons
              depending on
              electrical sensors and vehicle license plates. Firstly, we developed a prototype using LDRsensors and
              Arduino UNO to
              reduce the electricity consumption in the street light. Secondly, moisture sensors along with
              microcontrollers and servo
              motors were used to prevent traffic jams in the water-clogging situation. Then, a sonar sensor was
              integrated with a

            <h4>A Survey on Deep Learning-based Smart Assistive Aids for
              Visually Impaired Individuals</h4>
            <p>Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in interacting with society. However, smart
              canes equipped
              with sensors and
              cameras provide a promising solution for safe navigation. AI-based
              assistive devices, including smart canes, utilize machine learning
              algorithms like YOLO and SSD for object detection and recognition
              through in-built cameras. These devices often employ a standard
              controller and switch for navigation strategy, while sensors such
              as Ultrasonic sensors, I/R Lasers, Rain sensors aid in detecting a
              variety of obstacles such as physical objects or water. With continued research, such technology could
              greatly enhance
              the visually
              impaired person’s ability to interact with their surroundings and
              potentially even travel independently.</p>

              Finding the requirements, maintaining the communication to develop the website, uploading on the server
              and
              troubleshooting was my task.</p>
